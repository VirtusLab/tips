## Grammar tips 1
### 7 Aug 2020

Questions in English typically have inversion (verb-before-subject) `How does it work?`,
but relative clauses (aka Polish _zdania podrzędne_) typically don't have inversion:
`I asked how it works`; the same applies to titles/captions: `How It Works` ![](arrows_counterclockwise)

There's never future tense after `when` in relative clauses, and (almost) never after `if` ![](crystal_ball)

Probably the single most common grammar mistake (committed by natives and non-natives alike)
is using `it's` (the contracted form of `it is`) instead of `its` (the possessive form of `it`) ![](it)

In the `X Y` construct like `bus stops`, typically only `Y` is pluralized (so not `busses stops`);
if a preposition is involved, however (e.g. `Y of X`), then both words can be plural
depending on the specific use case (`stops of busses`) ![](bus)


## Handy phrases
### 13 Aug 2020

Looking for a phrase meaning `get things done` in the sense similar to Polish _ogarnąć_? <br/>
How about `sort (sth) out` or `get sth sorted` ![](male-construction-worker)

Want to specify that the given review comment/remark is an insignificant/just-nice-to-have one? <br/>
How about saying that it's a `Nitpick: ...` or just `Nit: ...` ![](grammar-nazi)

Bringing up the same point again and again (e.g. on the review)? <br/>
Just use `Ditto` (aka `the same thing again`, from Italian, adopted in informal English) ![](it)

Tired of writing phrases like `if I remember/understand correctly`? <br/>
They've already got a well-established initialism/acronym: `IIRC`, `IIUC`, `CMIIW` (`correct me if I'm wrong`),
`AFAICS` (`as far as I can see`, a variation of well-known `AFAIK`) ![](writing_hand)


## Pronunciation
### 19 Aug 2020

One of the best/easiest things to do in order to improve pronunciation in any modern language
is to start relying on **IPA** (International Phonetic Alphabet) instead of voice recordings
or semi-formal notation (like `now·tei·shn`) for learning ![](beer)

This is esp. important in English which is notoriously **non-deterministic**
(e.g. has 7 different ways to read _ough_ depending on... nothing in particular) ![a](this_is_fine)

IPA makes you spot the common rules in the otherwise unruly English pronunciation, for instance:

![](one) there are many more different **vowel** (aka Polish _samogłoski_) sounds than in Polish
and the correspondence between the written characters and spoken vowel sounds is rather loose;
the set of **consonants** (aka Polish _spółgłoski_) is relatively narrow, in turn

![](two) **th** corresponds to 2 distinct sounds: it's either voiced `ð` (as in _the_, _that_, _they_, _there_)
or unvoiced `θ` (as in _thousand_, _throw_)

![](three) **the** is pronounced in ~3 different ways: as either `ði:` when stressed (with long `i:`),
`ði` when before a vowel or `ðə` when before a consonant (where `ə` aka _schwa_ is a
short unstressed sound between Polish _a/y..._ as the leading _a_ in about)

![](four) **au** is typically long `ɔ:` or `ɑ` as in e.g. _auxiliary_ `ɔ:ɡ'zɪliəri`
(no `u` sound... that's a very common mistake for non-natives)


## Proper pronunciation 1
### 28 Aug 2020

Contrary to the common practice/belief:

![](one) basic is pronounced as `'beɪsɪk` (not `-zɪk`), mustn't is pronounced as `'mʌsnt`
(not `-znt`)... `'` precedes the stressed syllable in IPA, btw

![](two) a standalone letter _i_ is almost **never** pronounced like the Polish `i` sound;
in words like _give_, _is_, _will_, it's actually the `ɪ` sound
— somewhere between Polish _i_ and _y_: `ɡɪv`, `ɪz`, `wɪl`

![](three) in English (except in loanwords), there's **no** sound corresponding to the Polish _c_
letter as in _Cecylia_; _c_ in words like access (`'ækses`), _center_, _circuit_ (`'sɜ:(r)kɪt`) is just pronounced as `s`

![](four) _-able_ suffix (other than in single-syllable words like _able_ itself, _table_, _fable_ etc.)
is pronounced as `əbl`, not `eɪbl`; hence _vegetable_ is `'vedʒtəbl`, _capable_ is `'keɪpəbl`, _comfortable_ is `'kʌmftəbl` etc.

![](five) unlike in Polish, double consonant (_nn_, _tt+_ etc.) is almost never pronounced as double;
e.g. Anna is `'ænə` and not `'æn-nə`

As of 2020, when the gender of the subject isn't known (_as in, Each participant should provide HIS (???) photo_),
the golden standard is to use `they` rather than e.g. `he/she`, let alone just `he`:
_Each participant should provide THEIR photo_ ![](nooo-you-cant-just)

Unlike in Polish where words like `który`, `że` etc. are usually preceded by a comma,
there's usually **no comma** before `that`: _I learned that all of the employees that you mentioned still work here_ ![](semicolon)

Unlike after `to` (which is followed by infinitive, aka Polish _bezokolicznik_),
if there's a verb after a preposition like `for`, `of`, `about` etc.,
it's almost always in the `-ing` form (aka gerund) ![](to)

There's a difference between **hyphen** (`-`), **en dash** (`–`, `&ndash;`) and **em dash** (`—`, `&mdash;`) ![](nerd_face) <br/>
TL;DR: use hyphen inside words like _mass-produced_, en dash for ranges like _2010–2020_,
em dash to separate parts of the sentence ![](dash)


## Proper pronunciation 2
### 3 Nov 2020

Contrary to the popular practice/belief:

**FAQ** is more safe to pronounce as `ef eɪ 'kju:` and not in a way, ahem,
resembling certain common English verb ![](a-o-czym-mowa)

**focus** is pronounced as `'fəʊkəs` and not as e.g. `'fɔkjus` ![](mag)

**urgent** is pronounced as `'ɜ:(r)dʒ(ə)nt`, with long o-umlaut-like `ɜ:`. <br/>
Similarly, **occur** is pronounced as `ə'kɜ:(r)`, and not as `ə'kju:(r)`. <br/>
**occurrence** can be pronunced as `ə'kɜ:rəns` as well as `ə'kʌrəns` with `ʌ` instead (as in _up_) ![](mountain)

**author** is, quite surprisingly, pronounced as `'ɔːθə(r)` with long Polish `o` sound
at the beginning (and not `au...`); similarly for **authorize**, **authenticate** etc. ![](o)


## Proper pronunciation 3
### 4 Jan 2021

Beware of common traps/inconsistencies in the technical language:

_**infinite**_ is `'ɪnfɪnət`, which is vowel-wise consistent with _**infinity**_ `ɪn'fɪnəti`, <br/>
but not consistent with _**finite**_ `'faɪnaɪt`, which surprisingly has two `aɪ`s ![](infinity)

_**major**_ is `'meɪdʒə(r)`, but _**majority**_ is `mə'dʒɒrəti` (no `eɪ`) ![](hushed) <br/>
_**minor**_ `'maɪnə(r)`, is in turn consistent with _**minority**_ `maɪ'nɒrəti` (`aɪ` in both) ![](relieved)

According to both [Martin Odersky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky)
and common practice, _**Scala**_ is pronounced as `'skɑ:lə` (no `eɪ`); <br/>
_**able**_ is of course `'eɪb(ə)l` (with `eɪ`), but these vowels get confusingly "swapped" in _**scalable**_: `'skeɪləb(ə)l` ![](scala)

_ch_ in Greek-derived words like _**schema**_ or _**tech(nology)**_ is pronounced as `k`, not `h` ![](flag-gr) <br/>
In fact, _ch_ in English is rarely pronounced as anything close to `h`... one exception might
be the sound in _loch_ (_e.g. Loch Ness_), which falls somewhat close ![](flag-scotland)
