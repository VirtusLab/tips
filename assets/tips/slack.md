## Quick link creation
### 4 May 2020

If you have a url in the clipboard you can select the word you want to turn into a link and press
`Ctrl + V` on ![](linux) (or `CMD + V` on ![](apple)) and your word becomes a link! ![a](haha-babuga) <br/>
You need to have rich editor for that to work (which is the default).


## Conversations with more people
### 1 Sep 2020

For conversations with 2 or more other people (3 or more including yourself),
prefer (potentially short-lived) **private channels** over direct messages ![](halooo)

**Searching** a channel by a name is much easier than looking for the correct combination of people,
esp. if there're 4+ people involved ![](sleuth_or_spy)

The fact that channel has a **name** helps keep the conversation more focused on the matter at hand ![](goncern) <br/>
Unlike DMs, channels have **topics** that can be used e.g. to keep 1-2 important links ![](link)

Also, channels allow for **adding people** more smoothly than direct messages;
adding a person to a DM is basically starting a new conversation with the new combination of people ![](add-reaction)


## The latest message
### 25 Jan 2021

To edit your latest message in the given Slack conversation, use **Ctrl+Arrow Up** when the
cursor is in the editor ![](writing_hand)

Under top-left corner menu &#10140; Preferences &#10140; Accessibility, you can configure **Arrow Up**
to either edit latest message (same as Ctrl+Arrow Up), <br/>
or, even more conveniently, to **set focus on the latest message** ![](gear) <br/>
Once a message gets the focus, multiple single-key shortcuts are available,
including **Delete**, **E** (again, just edit), **R** (add emoji reaction) or **U**
(mark conversation as unread from this message) ![](keyboard) <br/>
Also, see **Ctrl+?** for all available shortcuts ![](bookmark_tabs)


## One-click reactions
### 12 Apr 2021

Under top-left corner dropdown menu > _Preferences_ > _Messages & media_, it's possible to configure
the three one-click reactions that show up next to each message when hovered,
saving the need to open the emoji selector dialog:
