## Bikeshedding
### 21 Sep 2020

One of the common traps in any discussions, tech and non-tech alike (including code review) is **bikeshedding** ![](goncern)

The term is derived from a hypothetical committee debating a **nuclear power plant design**,
which instead of spending the time on the hard&important matters (the **reactor**),
prefers to focus on trivilialites like a place for employees to store their bikes
(aka **bike sheds**) &mdash; in other words, the committee is _bikeshedding_ ![](atom_symbol)

This is unfortunately a natural tendency &mdash; the human **need to be useful** often ends up
taking over the need to achieve the goal (esp. if the situation doesn't give a chance
to be personally useful towards that goal) ![](sad)

In the nuclear plant example, committee members are more willing to discuss a trivial topic
(bike sheds) where they're more likely to have a useful insight, than the incomparably
more important topic (reactor) where they're less likely to have any valuable input ![](care)


## Blurring background on Google Meet
### 6 Oct 2020

Google Meet allows for blurring the background (everything but face and hands)
during the video calls ![](hushed)

Open three-dot (aka _kebab menu_) icon in the bottom-right corner
and select `Turn on background blur` ![a](halalparrot)


## During presentation
### 19 Oct 2020

To avoid embarassing situations when sharing screen, **turn off desktop notifications**
from IMs like Slack completely, or install a dedicated notification silencer app
(MacOS: possibly [muzzle](https://muzzleapp.com) ?) ![a](this_is_fine)

You should also take into account that the person on the receiving end of the communication
might have their desktop notifications enabled... as a paranoid measure, it's better not to
communicate anything confidential until the other person starts responding to you
(at which point they're less likely to accidentally leak the message via a screenshare) ![](scream)

Along the same lines, it's always best to share as little screen as possible
(single browser tab or application window instead of the entire desktop). <br/>
Note that depending on OS/desktop env, sharing a single window might prevent dialogs displayed
by this window from getting shared as well ![](frown)


## Communication good practices
### 26 Nov 2020

In business/technical communication, regardless of language (English, Polish, ...)
and whether it's written or spoken:

![](one) Beware of relying too much on the pronouns like `that`, `this`, `those`, `its` etc. ![](goncern) <br/>
They quickly become confusing in complex sentences
(_does this "its" refer to the 1st, 2nd or 3rd thing you've mentioned?_) ![a](async-parrot) <br/>
It's better to repeat explicitly what you're referring to (it's not a high school essay, repetitions are okay),
or at least use more unambiguous constructs like `the former` / `the latter` ![](male-teacher)

![](two) Beware that negations (`not`, `...n't`) can easily go unnoticed by the reader/listener...
thus completely inverting the sense of the sentence ![](stop-sign) <br/>
It's a good practice to stress the `NOT` word and `UN-`/`IN-`/`IM-`/...
prefixes both in written and spoken language ![](writing_hand) <br/>
**Side note**: probably the most notorious English word in this regard is `can't`,
which sounds very similar to `can` ![a](this_is_fine) <br/>
Trick: pronounce a different vowel in `can` (`/kæn/`) and in `can't` (`/kɑːnt/`),
that's easier to notice than just the `t` at the end or lack thereof ![](spurdo-phone)
